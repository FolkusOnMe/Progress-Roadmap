How do I make this a folder...

1. Understand the basics
  - Classes, Constructors, Methods.
  - How is it that things interact? Why do I need to make an instance of a thing?
  - Is private/public/static/final really necessary... why though. Why don't we want something to see something else. 
  - Generics. 
  - Why does the 'something something main args String' exist? 
  - Values vs References. Why is this a thing. 
  - Go through Dan's entire playlist for Processing/Java. Make all the bouncy balls. 
  - this `for(int i : array){ do something }` works very strangely. i doesn't go from 0 to the length of the array, it actually IS the values??

2. Add some complexity 
  - Algorithms.
    * Sorting 
    * Trees
    * Graphs 
    * Arrays
    * sundry
